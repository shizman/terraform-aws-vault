# Vault Automated Configuration Examples

This directory contains configuration scripts which update the base Consul installation to meet more stringent security and operational requirements that are typically seen in production environments.

The vision for this section of the repository is to house the most popular tools for configuration management such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet and Salt. As a baseline that should work in most environments, Bash scripts are provided.
